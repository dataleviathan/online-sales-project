**Online Advertisement and Its Impact on Sales**

**Overview**

This project explores how different online advertisement methods (pop-ups and email blasts) influence consumer purchasing behavior, using customer and sales data from Pop Runner. The analysis was conducted for a database systems course using SQL queries.

**Objective**

Determine whether online advertisements increase sales.

**Key Questions**

Which age and gender group contributes the most to sales?

Are email blasts effective in driving purchases?

Are pop-up ads effective?

**Dataset**

9,032 customers

Variables: Customer ID, gender, age, loyalty level, email and pop-up interactions, total sales

Two advertisement channels analyzed:

Pop-ups: Show discount codes upon website visit

Emails: Sent to all users, trackable if opened

Analysis & Findings

**Customer Background**

~76% of customers are female, average age: ~30.6

Male customers are older on average (~32.5)

Loyalty levels range from 0 (low) to 4 (high); higher loyalty correlates with older age

**Advertisement Reach**

50% did not receive a pop-up

Only 16% added a discount code via pop-up

Only 8% of users opened the marketing email

**Sales Results**

Pop-ups: No significant improvement; users who didn’t receive pop-ups spent more

Emails: Highly effective; users who opened emails spent nearly twice as much on average

Top spender opened an email; lowest spender ignored the pop-up

**Recommendations**

Focus on email marketing, especially targeting females around age 30

Pop-ups alone aren’t effective; consider embedding discount codes in emails instead

Improve email subject lines to increase open rate

Combine incentives with email for better conversion
